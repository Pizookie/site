        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on the study of cooling the leading edge of the hypersonic vehicle.The approach to deal with the heated surface is to impinge the spray formed from the liquid sheet. The nozzle used for gnerating this LS is fabricated using dry-etching technique. Also, the experiment was carried out using the numerical method inorder to simulate the liquid sheet using dynamic adaptation.</p>
        
        <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Characterize the dynamics of liquid sheets under different conditions.</li>
            <li>Develop experimental setups for generating and studying liquid sheets.</li>
            <li>Investigate the cooling effectiveness of liquid sheet jets on hypersonic leading edges.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Research Findings</h2>
        <p>So far, the research has revealed that the fluid parameters such as the Reynolds number, Weber number and capillary number influence the shape and size of the liquid sheet. By altering the these parameters, one can control the formation of spray using the microfluidic device. </p>
        
        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>Future work will focus on developing a microfluidic device in order to generate more stable liquid sheet. </p>
